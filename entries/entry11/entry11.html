    Rudy's on the midway and Jacob's in the hole. The monkey's on the ladder, the devil shovels coal
    With crows as big as airplanes, the lion has three heads, And someone will eat the skin that he sheds.
    Well, the earth died screaming while I lay dreaming, Well, the earth died screaming while I lay dreaming of you.
    What does it matter, a dream of love or a dream of lies? We're all gonna be the same place when we die Your spirit don't leave knowing your face or your name 
    And the wind through your bones is all that remains The quill from a buzzard, the blood writes the word I wanna know am I the sky or a bird? 
    'Cause hell's boiling over and heaven is full We're chained to the world and we all gotta pull Now the killer was smiling with nerves made of stone 
    He climbed the stairs and the gallows groaned And the people's hearts were pounding They were throbbing, they were red He swung out over the crowd, 
    I heard the hangman said And we're all gonna be, yeah yeah I said we're all gonna be, yeah yeah. I said we're all gonna be, yeah yeah I said we're all gonna be just dirt in the ground.
    Well, pale face said to the eyeball kid She just goes clank and boom and steam A halo, wings, horns and a tail Shoveling coal inside my dreams There are no laws, she's made of cream She's such a scream
    Qui bon tres bien, nails in cement A Donnie gal from mortal clay The plow is red, the well is full Inside the dollhouse of her skull A cheetah coat fills up with steam She's such a scream
    All crooked lines, her fireplace A milktrain so clean, machine gun haste You'll ride the only wall of shame And drag that chain across the state Her lips are red, she is the queen She's such a scream
    Well, the time will come when the wind will shout (All stripped down, all stripped down) And all the sinners know what I'm talking about (All stripped down, all stripped down)
    When all the creatures of the world are gonna line up at the gate (All stripped down, all stripped down) And you better be on time and you better not be late (All stripped, all stripped) (All stripped down, all stripped down)
    Well, you know in your heart what you gotta bring (All stripped down, all stripped down) No big mink coat, no diamond ring (All stripped down, all stripped down)
    Well, take off your paint and take off your rouge (All stripped down, all stripped down) Let your backbone flip and let your spirit shine through (All stripped down, all stripped down) (I want you all stripped, all stripped, all stripped down)
    They're lining up to mad dog your tilt-a-whirl Three shots for a dollar, win a real live doll All the lies that you tell, I believe them so well Take them back, take them back to your red house For that fearful leap into the dark
    Oh well, I did my time in the jail of your arms Now Ophelia wants to know where she should turn Tell me, what did you do? What did you do the last time? Why don't you do that? Well, go on ahead and take this the wrong way Time's not your friend
    Do you cry? Do you pray? Do you wish them away? Are you still leaving nothing but bones in the way? Did you bury the carnival with the lions and all? Excuse me while I sharpen my nails
    And just who are you? Who are you this time? You look rather tired, are you pretending to love? Well, I hear that it pays well How do your pistol and your Bible and your sleeping pills go?
    Are you still jumping out of windows in expensive clothes? Well, I fell in love with your sailor's mouth and your wounded eyes You better get down on the floor Don't you know this is war? 
    Tell me who are you this time? Tell me who are you this time? The ocean doesn't want me today But I'll be back tomorrow to play And the strangels will take me Down deep in their brine The mischievous braingels
    Down into the endless blue wine I'll open my head and let out all of my time I'd love to go drowning And to stay and to stay But the ocean doesn't want me today I'll go in up to here, it can't possibly hurt All they will find is my beer and my shirt
    The riptide is raging and the lifeguard's away But the ocean doesn't want me today But the ocean doesn't want me today The ocean doesn't want me today Well, Jesus gonna be here He gonna be here soon He's gonna cover us up with leaves 
    With a blanket from the moon With a promise and a vow And a lullaby for my brow Well, Jesus gonna be here He gonna be here soon Well, I'm not gonna do nothin' but wait here I don't have to shout, yeah I got me no reason And I got no doubt, yeah
    I'm gonna get myself unfurled From this mortal coiled-up world Jesus gonna be here Gonna be here soon, yeah I got to keep my eyes, keep 'em wide open, yeah
    So I can see my Lord, yeah I'm gonna watch the horizon For my brand new Ford, yeah Well, I can hear him rolling on down the lane I said "Hollywood be thy name" 'Cause Jesus gonna be here He gonna be here soon, yeah
    Well, I got to keep myself, keep myself faithful And you know I've been so good, yeah Except for drinking But He knew that I would, yeah Well, I'm gonna leave this place better
    Than the way I found that it was And Jesus gonna be here Gonna be here soon, yeah I know my Jesus gonna be here He gonna be here soon, yeah I know my Jesus gonna be here Gonna be here soon, yeah
    Well, the ice man's mule is parked outside the bar Where a man with missing fingers plays a strange guitar And the German dwarf dances with the butcher's son And tonight, a little rain never hurt no one
    Well, they're dancing on the roof and the ceiling's coming down And I sleep with my shovel and my leather gloves And a little trouble makes it worth the going And a little rain never hurt no one
    Oh, the world is round and I'll go around You must risk something that matters Oh, my hands are strong, I'll take any man here If it's worth the going, it's worth the ride
    She was fifteen years old and she'd never seen the ocean She climbed into a van with a vagabond And the last thing she said was "I love you, Mom" And a little rain never hurt no one And a little rain never hurt no one
    The women all control their men with razors and with wrists And the princess squeezes grape juice from a torrid, bloody kiss What will you be wearing there? The lion or the raven head? The flesh will all be tearing, but the tale will be my own
    In the colosseum In the colosseum In the colosseum tonight In the colosseum In the colosseum In the colosseum tonight This one's for the balcony and this one's for the floor
    As the senators decapitate the presidential whore The bald-headed senators are splashing in the blood The dogs are having someone who is screaming in the mud In the colosseum
    In the colosseum In the colosseum tonight In the colosseum In the colosseum In the colosseum tonight Now it's raining and it's pouring on the pillaging and goring
    The constable is swinging from the chains For the dead, there is no story, no memory, no blame Their families shout blue murder, but tomorrow it's the same
    In the colosseum In the colosseum In the colosseum tonight In the colosseum Call 'em as we see 'em In the colosseum tonight A slowly-acting poison will be given to the favorite one The dark horse will bring glory to the jailer and his men
    It's always much more sporting when there's families in the pit And the madness of the crowd is an epileptic fit In the colosseum In the colosseum In the colosseum tonight In the colosseum
    We call 'em as we see 'em In the colosseum tonight No justice here, no liberty, no reason, no blame There's no cause to taint the sweetest taste of blood And greetings from the nation as we shake the hands of time They're taking their ovation, the vultures stay behind
    In the colosseum In the colosseum In the colosseum tonight In the colosseum In the colosseum In the colosseum tonight I'm going out west where the wind blows tall. 'Cause Tony Franciosa Used to date my ma, they got some money out there,  they're giving it away. 
    I'm gonna do what I want and I'm gonna get paid. Do what I want and I'm gonna get paid Little brown sausages Lying in the sand I ain't no extra, baby I'm a leading man Well, my parole officer Will be proud of me
    With my Olds 88 and the devil on a leash I know karate, Voodoo too. I'm gonna make myself available to you I don't need no make up I got real scars I got hair on my chest I look good without a shirt. Well I don't lose my composure
    In a high speed chase Well my friends think I'm ugly I got a masculine face I got some dragstrip courage I can really drive a bed  I'm gonna change my name to Hannibal Or maybe just Rex Change my name to Hannibal Or maybe just Rex Change my name to Hannibal Maybe just Rex
    There was a murder in the red barn A murder in the red barn The trees are bending over And the cows are lying down The autumn's taking over You can hear the buckshot hounds
    The watchman said to Reba the Loon "Was that pale at Manzanita? Or was it Blind Bob the coon?" Pin it on a drifter They sleep beneath the bridge One plays the violin And sleeps inside a fridge
    It was a murder in the red barn Murder in the red barn Someone's crying in the woods Someone's burying all his clothes Now Slam the Crank from Wheezer Slept outside last night and froze Roadkill has its seasons, just like anything
    There's possums in the autumn And there's farm cats in the spring There was a murder in the red barn A murder in the red barn Now thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house
    Or covet thy neighbor's wife But for some, murder is the only door Through which they enter life Now they surrounded the house
    They smoked him out, took him off in chains The sky turned black and bruised And we had months of heavy rains Now the ravens nest in the rotted roof Of Chenoweth's old place And no one's asking Cal About that scar upon his face
    'Cause there's nothin' strange About an axe with bloodstains in the barn There's always some killin' You got to do around the farm A murder in the red barn A murder in the red barn
    There was a murder in the red barn A murder in the red barn Now thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house Or covet thy neighbor's wife But for some, murder is the only door Through which they enter life Now they surrounded the house
    They smoked him out, took him off in chains The sky turned black and bruised And we had months of heavy rains Now the ravens nest in the rotted roof Of Chenoweth's old place And no one's asking Cal About that scar upon his face
    'Cause there's nothin' strange About an axe with bloodstains in the barn There's always some killin' You got to do around the farm A murder in the red barn A murder in the red barn
    Well, take an eye for an eye A tooth for a tooth Just like they say in the Bible Well, never leave a trace Or forget a face Of any man at the table Any man at the table
    Oh, when the moon is a cold, chiseled dagger And it's sharp enough to draw blood from a stone He rides through your dreams on a coach and horses And the fence posts in the moonlight look like bones
    Well, they've stopped trying to hold him With mortar, stone and chain He broke out of every prison Where the boots mount the staircase The door's flung back open He's not there, for he has risen He's not there, for he has risen
    Some say he once killed a man with a guitar string He's been seen at the table with kings Well, he once saved a baby from drowning There are those that say beneath his coat, there are wings Well, some say they fear him 
    Well, some say they fear him Others admire him Because he steals his promise But one look in his eye And everyone denies Ever having met him Ever having met him He can turn himself into a stranger
    Well, they broke a lot of canes on his hide He was born away in a cornfield A fever beats in his head just like a drum inside Some say they fear him, others admire him Because he steals his promise
    But one look in his eye Everyone denies Ever having met him Ever having met him Ever having met him Ever having met him Ever having met him Ever having met him
    I grew up here, all of my life I dreamed someday I'd go Where the blue-eyed girls and the red guitars And the naked rivers flow Now I'm not all I thought I'd be 
    I've always stayed around I've been as far as Mercy and Grand Frozen to the ground I can't stay here and I'm scared to leave So kiss me once and then I'll go to hell, I might as well Be whistlin' down the wind
    Bus is at the corner The clock on the wall A broken-down windmill Ain't no wind at all I yelled and I cursed If I stay here, I'll rust And I'm stuck like a shipwreck Out here in the dust
    Well, the sky is red and the world is on fire And the corn is taller than me And a dog is tied to a wagon of rain And the road is wet as the sea
    But sometimes the music from a dance Will carry across the plains And the places that I'm dreaming of Do they dream only of me? There are places where they never sleep And the circus never ends So I will take the Marley Bone Coach And be whistlin' down the wind
    So I will take the Marley Bone Coach And be whistlin' down the wind when I'm lyin' in my bed at night I don't wanna grow up Nothin' ever seems to turn out rightI don't wanna grow up
    How do you move in a world of fog That's always changing things? Makes me wish that I could be a dog Well, when I see the price that you pay I don't wanna grow up I don't ever wanna be that way I don't wanna grow up
    Seems like folks turn into things That they'd never want The only thing to live for is today I'm gonna put a hole in my TV set I don't wanna grow up Open up the medicine chest And I don't wanna grow up I don't wanna have to shout it out
    I don't want my hair to fall out I don't wanna be filled with doubt I don't wanna be a good boy scout I don't wanna have to learn to count I don't wanna have the biggest amount I don't wanna grow up
    Well, when I see my parents fight I don't wanna grow up They all go out and drinking all night And I don't wanna grow up I'd rather stay here in my room Nothin' out there but sad and gloom
    I don't wanna live in a big old tomb On Grand Street, oo When I see the 5 o'clock news I don't wanna grow up They comb their hair and shine their shoes I don't wanna grow up Stay around in my old hometown
    I don't wanna put no money down I don't wanna get me a big old loan Work them fingers to the bone I don't wanna float a broom Fall in love and get married, then boom How the hell did it get here so soon I don't wanna grow up.
    C'mon let me get up on it Well, there's one thing you can't lose It's that feel Your pants, your shirt, your shoes But not that feel Throw it out in the rain You whip it like a dog You can chop it down like an old dead tree You always see it
    When you're coming into town Once you hang it on the wall You can never take it down But there's one thing you can't lose And it's that feel You can pawn your watch and chain But not that feel
    Always comes and finds you It will always hear you cry I cross my wooden leg And I swear on my glass eye It will never leave you high and dry Never leave you loose It's harder to get rid of than tattoos
    But there's one thing you can't lose Is that feel One thing you can't lose It's that feel You can throw it off a bridge You can lose it in a fire You can leave it at the altar
    It will make you out a liar Fall down in the street You can leave it in the lurch Well, you say that it's gospel But I know that it's only church but there's one thing you can't lose And it's that feel, it's that feel One thing you can't lose
    And it's that feel One thing you can't lose And it's that feel One thing you can't lose And it's that feel

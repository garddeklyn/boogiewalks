    See, my rhymes are the type of fly rhymes, that can only get down with my crew. 
    And if you try, to take lines or bite rhymes, 
    we'll show you how The Refugees do
    Yeah, yeah behold, as my odes, manifold on your rhymes
    Two MCs can't occupy the same space at the same time
    It's against the laws of physics
    So weep as your sweet dreams break up like Eurythmics
    Rap rejects, my tape deck, ejects projectile
    Whether Jew or Gentile, I rank top percentile
    Many styles, more powerful than gamma rays
    My grammar pays like Carlos Santana plays "Black Magic Woman"
    So while you fuming, I'm consuming mango juice under Polaris
    You just embarrassed 'cause it's your last tango in Paris

    M to the A to the S to the K put the mask 'pon me face just to make the next day. 
    Feds be hawking me, jokers be stalking me
    I walk the streets and camouflage my identity
    My posse in the Brooklyn wear the mask
    My crew in the Jersey wear the mask
    Stick up kids doing boogie woogie wear the mask
    Yeah, everybody wear the mask, but how long will it last?

    <h3>Twenty-twenty-twenty four hours to go
        I wanna be sedated
        Nothin' to do, nowhere to go-o-oh
        I wanna be sedated.
        Just get me to the airport, put me on a plane
        Hurry, hurry, hurry before I go insane
        I can't control my fingers, I can't control my brain
        Oh no-o-o-o-o.
        I saw her today
        I saw her face, it was a face I loved
        And I knew I had to run away, yeah
        And get down on my knees and pray, yeah
        That they'd go away.
        Still it begins-a
        Needles and pins-a
        Because of all my pride
        The tears I gotta hide.
        I used to be an A student
        I never used to complain
        I used to be a truant
        But I'm still the same
        Bad bad brain
        Bad bad brain
        You by the phone
        You all alone
        It's a long way back to Germany
        It's a long way back to Germany.
        You know it's generally known
        You got everything at home
        Kisses out of desperation
        Bring you more aggravation.
    </h3>
